# Your-Own-Tic-Tac-Toe

Have you ever played Tic-Tac-Toe? If you are an American or a simple person, you are no stranger to playing Tic-Tac-Toe with the number of columns and rows of 3. If anyone can hit the Xs and O's arranged in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal with a length of 3 will be the winner.

If it were that simple, I would never have created this software. With only 3 rows, 3 columns and the number of signs must be 3, you can completely hard code and repeat if loops. In addition, it is also much less tactical because sometimes you will not be able to determine who is the winner after just one game.
As a Vietnamese, Tic-Tac-Toe has been associated with my childhood whenever I have free time in class. We need 5 marks to hit in order to win. Also, the number of rows and columns is also infinite (depending on the width of the page.) I was wondering why I didn't make a game where we can easily tweak those stats to fit. with different gameplay.

So Tic-tac-toe Terminal was created when I was a student in 11th grade. It was quite inconvenient to display the game only on the terminal as well as the process of entering x, y positions to mark. After a long time, I seem to have forgotten it. But one day I realized I wanted to make it a real game, easily accessible to other players. And this is when I started creating this simple game.
I use the pygame library and it's the only library you need to install with the <pre>pip install pygame</pre> command.
